---------------------------------------------------

1. Open the link in the 'your results', the one called "view scores".

2. For each board that we played, left-click the 'play' button next
to our names, copy the link, and paste it into a file.

3. Run verify-session.py to make sure you have each board entered,
exactly once: ./verify-session.py <filename>

4. Store the deals into the database:
   ./store-deals.py -s <session-date> <filename>

5. For each board, gather the auction, result, and opening lead.

6. Run "./add-info.py <session>" to enter the data.

7. Gather matchpoint data for each board.

8. Run "./enter-match-points.py" to enter matchpoint data into a file.

9. Run "./add-match-points.py <file>" to update the database. (You can
   use '-d' to sanity-check the data first.
